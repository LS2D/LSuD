# LSμD: Large-Scale MicroHH Dynamics

(LS)²D's sister Python package, designed specifically for nesting real-life LES with open boundary conditions into large-scale weather models like ERA5 and ICON (or itself!).

Unlike (LS)²D, LSμD is designed specifically for MicroHH, using the specific approach we chose for lateral boundary conditions, sponge layers, data structures, and other design decisions related to nesting.
